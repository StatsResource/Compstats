\frametitle{Mutual Information}
\textbf{Joint Entropies:}\\
Using the input probabilities $P(x_i)$, output probabilities $P(y_i)$, transition probabilities $P(y_i|x_i)$,
and joint probabilities $P(x_i,y_j)$, we can define the following various entropy functions for a channel
with m inputs and n outputs:

\begin{itemize}
\item $H(X) = - \sum ^{m}_{i=1} P(x_i) \mbox{log}_2 P(x_i)$%; P(x;) (10.21)
\item $H(Y) = - \sum ^{n}_{j=1} P(y_j) \mbox{log}_2 P(y_j)$
\item $H(X, Y)= - \sum ^{n}_{j=1}\sum ^{m}_{i=1} P(x_i,y_j) \mbox{log}_2 P(x_i,y_j)$
\end{itemize}


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\frametitle{Mutual Information: Joint Entropy}
These entropies can be interpreted as follows:\begin{itemize}\item $ H(X)$ is the average uncertainty of the channel input,
and $H(Y)$ is the average uncertainty of the channel output.\item  The joint entropy $H(X,Y)$ is the average uncertainty of the communication channel as a
whole.\end{itemize}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\frametitle{Mutual Information: Conditional Entropy}
\begin{itemize}
\item The conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$ is a
measure of the average uncertainty remaining about the channel input after the channel output has
been observed. \item This is sometimes called the equivocation of X with respect to Y.  \item The
conditional entropy $H(Y|X)$ is the average uncertainty of the channel output given that X was
transmitted.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item $H(X| Y)= - \sum ^{n}_{j=1}\sum ^{m}_{i=1} P(x_i,y_j) \mbox{log}_2 P(x_i|y_j)$
\item $H(Y|X)= - \sum ^{n}_{j=1}\sum ^{m}_{i=1} P(x_i,y_j) \mbox{log}_2 P(y_j|x_i)$
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\frametitle{Mutual Information : Useful Identities}
Two useful relationships among the types of entropies are
\begin{itemize}
\item $H(X,Y)=H(X|Y)+H(Y) $
\item $H(X,Y)=H(Y|X)+H(X) $
\end{itemize}
(Remark : compare to identities in probability theory)



\frametitle{Mutual Information}
The mutual information $I(X; Y)$ of a channel is defined by
\[ I(X; Y) = H(X) -  H(X|Y) \mbox{    (b/symbol) } \]

Alternatively we can define it as either
\[ I(X; Y) = H(Y) -  H(Y|X) \mbox{     (b/symbol) } \]
 or as
\[ I(X; Y) = H(Y)+ H(Y)  - H(X,Y) \mbox{    (b/symbol) } \]


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\frame{
\frametitle{Entropy: some remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Entropy is the uncertainty of a single random variable. \item We can define \textbf{\emph{conditional entropy }}$H(X|Y)$, which is the entropy of a random variable
conditional on the knowledge of another random variable. \item The reduction in uncertainty due to another random variable is called the \textbf{\emph{mutual information}}.
\end{itemize}
}



\frametitle{Channel Capacity}

\textbf{A. Channel Capacity per Symbol C:}\\
The channel capacity per symbol of a DMC is defined as
\[
C. = \mbox{max }I(X; Y) \mbox{ b/symbol }
\]
where the maximization is over all possible input probability distributions {P(x,)} on X. Note that the
channel capacity CA is a function of only the channel transition probabilities that define the channel.
\textbf{B. Channel Capacity per Second C:}\\
If r symbols are being transmitted per second, then the maximum rate of transmission of
information per second is rC>.. This is the channel capacity per second and is denoted by C (bls):
C : rC, b/s

\end{itemize}
}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 4 Huffman Coding-%

\frame{

Huffman coding is a method of lossless data compression, and a form of entropy encoding. The basic idea is to map an alphabet to a representation for that alphabet, composed of strings of variable size, so that symbols that have a higher probability of occurring have a smaller representation than those that occur less often.

}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 4 Huffman Coding-%

\frame{
The key to Huffman coding is Huffman's algorithm, which constructs an extended binary tree of minimum weighted path length from a list of weights. For this problem, our list of weights consists of the probabilities of symbol occurrence. From this tree (which we will call a Huffman tree for convenience), the mapping to our variable-sized representations can be defined.
}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------Part 4 Huffman Coding-%
\frame{
The mapping is obtained by the path from the root of the Huffman tree to the leaf associated with a symbol's weight. The method can be arbitrary, but typically a value of 0 is associated with an edge to any left child and a value of 1 with an edge to any right child (or vice-versa). By concatenating the labels associated with the edges that make up the path from the root to a leaf, we get a binary string. Thus the mapping is defined.
}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\frame{
\frametitle{Inverse Mapping}
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to recover the symbols that make up a string from its representation after encoding, an inverse mapping must be possible. It is important that this mapping is unambiguous. \item We can show that all possible strings formed by concatenating any number of path labels in a Huffman tree are indeed unambiguous, due to the fact that it is a complete binary tree. \item That is, given a string composed of Huffman codes, there is exactly one possible way to decompose it into the individual codes.
\end{itemize}

Modelling is a process of constructing a knowledge system for
performing compression. Coding includes the design of the code and product of the compact data form.

\frametitle{Code efficiency and Code redundancy}
% Pg 253/254
The parameter $L$ represents the average number of bits per source symbol used in the source coding process.
The code efficiency is defined as \[\nu = {L_{min} \over L} \]where $L_{min}$ is the minimum possiblve value of $L$. When $\nu$ approaches unity, the codes is said to be efficient.
The code redundancy $\gamma$ is defined as $\gamma = 1- \nu$.



%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\frametitle{ Classification of Codes}
Classification of codes is best illustrated by an example. Consider Table 10-1 where a source of
size 4 has been encoded in binary codes with symbol 0 and 1.\\ \bigskip
% Table 10-I Binary Codes
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}
X& Code l& Code 2& Code 3 &Code 4& Code 5& Code 6\\
a& 01& 01 &1 &10 &01 &01\\
b& 01& 01 &1 &10 &01 &01\\
c &00 &10& 00& 110& 011 &001\\
d &11& 11& 11& 111 &0111 &0001\\
\end{tabular}


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\frametitle{Categorisation of Codes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fixed Length Codes
\item Variable Length Codes
\item Distinct Codes
\item Prefix-Free Codes
\item Uniquely decodable codes
\item Instantaneous Codes
\item Optimal Codes
\end{enumerate}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Fixed-Length Codes: A fixed-length code is one whose code word length is fixed. Code l and code Z of Table 10»l are
fixed-length codes with length 2.
\item[2.] Variable-Length Codes: A variable-length code is one whose code word length is not Exed, All codes of Table l0-l except
codes 1 and 2 are variable-length codes.
\item[3.] Distinct Codes:
A code is distinct if each code word is distinguishable from other code words. All codes of Table
10-1 except code 1 arc distinct codes—notice the codes for xl and xi.
\item[4.] Prefix-Free Codes:
A code in which no code word can be formed by adding code symbols to another code word is
called a prefix-free code. Thus, in a prefix-free code no code word is a prefix of another. Codes 2, 4,
and 6 of Table 10-l are prefix-free codes.
\end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\textbf{5. Uniquely Decodable Codes}
A distinct code is uniquely devudable if the original source sequence can be reconstructed perfectly
from the encoded binary sequence. Note that code 3 of Table 10-1 is not a uniquely decodable code.
For example, the binary sequence 1001 may correspond to the source sequences xzxgxz orxzxlxlxz.
\\ \bigskip
A sufticient condition to ensure that a code is uniquely decodable is that no code word is a prefix of
another. Thus, the prefix-free codes 2, 4, and 6 are uniquely decodable codes. Note that the pretix—t`ree
condition is not a necessary condition for unique decodability. \i\bigskip For example, code 5 of Table l0-l does
not satisfy the prefix-free condition, and yet it is uniquely decodable since the bit 0 indicates the
beginning of each code word of the code.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\textbf{6. Instantaneous Codes}
A uniquely decodable code is cmlled an inrtanruneous code if the end of any code word is
recognizable without examining subsequent code symbols. The instantaneous codes have the property
previously mentioned that no code word is a pretix of another code word. For this reason, prefix-free
codes are sometimes called instantaneous codes.
\textbf{7. Optimal Codes}
A code is said to be optimal if it is instantaneous and has mini.mu.rn average length L for a given
source with a given probability assignment for the source symbols.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\frametitle{ ENTROPY CODING}
The design of a variable-length code such that its average code word length approaches the
entropy of the DMS is often referred to as enlmpy coding. In this section we present two examples of
entropy coding.
\begin{itemize}
\item Shannon- Fano Coiding
\item Huffman Coding
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

% Page 255
\frame{A. Shannon-Fun Coding:}
An efficient code can be obtained by the following simple procedure, known as
Shannon- Fano algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] List the source symbols in order of decreasing probability.
\item[2.] Partition the set into two sets that are as close to equiprobable as possible, and assign 0 to the
upper set and 1 to the lower set.
\end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Page 256 Bottom
\frametitle{B. Huffman Encoding:}
In general, Huffman encoding results in an optimum code. Thus, it is the code that has the highest
efliciency.\\ The Huffman encoding procedure is as follows:
\begin{itemize}\item[1.] List the source symbols in order of decreasing probability.
\item[2.] Combine the probabilities of the two symbols having the lowest probabilities, and reorder
the resultant probabilities; this step is called reduction 1. The same procedure is repeated until
there are two ordered probabilities remaining.
\item[3.] Start encoding with the last reduction, which consists of exactly two ordered probabilities. Assign
0 as the first digit in the code words for all the source symbols associated with the first probability;
assign 1 to the second probability.
\item[4.] Now go back and assign 0 and 1 to the second digit for the two probabilities that were combined
in the previous reduction step, retaining all assignments made in Step 3.
\item[5.] Keep regressing this way until the first column is reached.
\end{itemize}


%An example of Huffman encoding is shown in Table 10-3.
%H(X) = 2.36b/symbol
%L = 2.38 b/symbol

\noindent \textbf{ ENTROPY CODING}
The design of a variable-length code such that its average code word length approaches the
entropy of the DMS is often referred to as enlmpy coding. In this section we present two examples of
entropy coding.
\begin{itemize}
\item Shannon- Fano Coiding
\item Huffman Coding
\end{itemize}

{A. Shannon-Fun Coding:}
An efficient code can be obtained by the following simple procedure, known as
Shannon- Fano algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] List the source symbols in order of decreasing probability.
\item[2.] Partition the set into two sets that are as close to equiprobable as possible, and assign 0 to the
upper set and 1 to the lower set.
\end{itemize}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Page 256 Bottom
\noindent \textbf{B. Huffman Encoding:}
In general, Huffman encoding results in an optimum code. Thus, it is the code that has the highest
efliciency.\\ The Huffman encoding procedure is as follows:
\begin{itemize}\item[1.] List the source symbols in order of decreasing probability.
\item[2.] Combine the probabilities of the two symbols having the lowest probabilities, and reorder
the resultant probabilities; this step is called reduction 1. The same procedure is repeated until
there are two ordered probabilities remaining.
\item[3.] Start encoding with the last reduction, which consists of exactly two ordered probabilities. Assign
0 as the first digit in the code words for all the source symbols associated with the first probability;
assign 1 to the second probability.
\item[4.] Now go back and assign 0 and 1 to the second digit for the two probabilities that were combined
in the previous reduction step, retaining all assignments made in Step 3.
\item[5.] Keep regressing this way until the first column is reached.
\end{itemize}


%An example of Huffman encoding is shown in Table 10-3.
%H(X) = 2.36b/symbol
%L = 2.38 b/symbol

\noindent \textbf{Self Information}Self-information
This is defined by the following mathematical formula:$I(A) = −logb P(A)$

The self-information of an event measures the amount of one's surprise
evoked by the event. The negative logarithm $−logb P(A)$ can also be written as \[
log_b  {1 \over P(A)} \]
Note that log(1) = 0, and that $| − log(P(A))|$ increases as P(A) decreases
from 1 to 0. This supports our intuition from daily experience. For example,
a low-probability event tends to cause more ``surprise".





{
\noindent \textbf{What is Information?}
\begin{itemize} \item Once we agree to define the information of an event ain terms of P(a), the properties (2) and (3) will be satisfied if the information in ais defined as
\[ I(a) = -log P(a)\]

\item Remark : The base of the logarithm depends on the unit of information to be used.

For a simple example, we will take a short phrase and derive our probabilities from a frequency count of letters within that phrase. The resulting encoding should be good for compressing this phrase, but of course will be inappropriate for other phrases with a different letter distribution.

Ambiguity occurs if there is any path to some symbol whose label is a prefix of the label of a path to some other symbol. In the Huffman tree, every symbol is a \textbf{\emph{leaf}}. Thus it is impossible for the label of a path to a leaf to be a prefix of any other path label, and so the mapping defined by Huffman coding has an inverse and decoding is possible.
}




\noindent \textbf{Source Coding}
\begin{itemize}
\item A conversion of the output of a DMS into a sequence of binary symbols (binary code word) is
called \textbf{\emph{source coding}}.
\item  The device that performs this conversion is called the source encoder.
\item
An objective of source coding is to minimize the average bit rate required for representation of the
source by reducing the redundancy of the information source.
\end{itemize}



\noindent \textbf{Source Coding : Code Length and Code Efficiency}
\begin{itemize}

\item
Let X be a DMS with finite entropy $H(X)$ and an alphabet $\{x_1 , \ldots,  x_m\}$, each with corresponding
probabilities of occurrence $P(x_i)$. \item Let the binary code word assigned to symbol $x_i$ by
the encoder have length $n_i$ b. \item The length of a code word is the number of binary digits
in the code word. The average code word length L, per source symbol is given by

\[ E(L) = \sum ^{m}_{i=1} P(x_i) n_i \]
\end{itemize}




\noindent \textbf{Source Coding : Code efficiency and Code redundancy}
% Pg 253/254
\begin{itemize}
\item The parameter $L$ (estimated by $E(L)$) represents the average number of bits per source symbol used in the source coding process.\item
The code efficiency is defined as \[\eta = {L_{min} \over L} \]where $L_{min}$ is the minimum possible value of $L$. When $\eta$ approaches unity, the codes is said to be efficient.
\item The code redundancy $\gamma$ is defined as $\gamma = 1- \eta$.
