\frametitle{Binomial Coefficients}

In the last class, we came across binomial coefficients. Informally, binomial coefficients are the number of ways $k$ items can be selected from a group of $n$ items. 
The binomial coefficient indexed by n and k is usually written as $^nC_k$ or
\[ {n \choose k}\].
$C$ is colloqially known as the ``choose operator".

\[ {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! \times (n-k)!} \]

(We call the operator the choose operator. We will use both notations interchangeably.)

\begin{itemize}
\item $n!$ and $k!$ are the coefficients of $n$ and $k$ respectively.
\item $n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1$
\item For example $5! = 5\times4\times3\times2\times1 = 120$
\item $n! = n \times (n-1)!$
\item Importantly $0! = 1$ not 0.
\end{itemize}
\[ {6 \choose 2} = \frac{6!}{2! \times (6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2! \times 4!}  \]\[\mbox{   } = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4!}{2! \times 4!} 
 = 30/2 =15 \]

\frametitle{Probability Mass Function}
(Formally defining something mentioned previously)
\begin{itemize} \item a probability mass function (pmf) is a \textbf{\emph{function}}
that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some
value.
\[P(X=k)\]
\item The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete
probability distribution
\item It is conventional to present the probability mass function in the form of a table.
\item The p.m.f of a value $k$ is often denoted $f(k)$.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{ Binomial Example 1 }
(Revision from Last Class)\\
Suppose a die is tossed 5 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 fours?

\textbf{Solution:} This is a binomial experiment in which the number of trials is equal to 5, the number of successes is equal to 2, and the probability of success on a single trial is 1/6 or about 0.167. 
\\
\bigskip
Therefore, the binomial probability is:

\[P(X=2) = ^5C_2 \times (1/6)^2 \times (5/6)^3 = 0.161\]

Suppose there is a container that contains 6 items.  The probability that any one of these items is defective is 0.3. Suppose all six items are inspected. 
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the probability of 3 defective components?
\item What is the probability of 4 defective components?
\end{itemize}

\[ P(3\text{ defects}) = f(3) = P(X = 3) = {6\choose 3}0.3^3 (1-0.3)^{6-3} = 0.1852 \]
\[ P(4\text{ defects}) = f(4) = P(X = 4) = {6\choose 4}0.3^4 (1-0.3)^{6-4} = 0.0595 \]

\frametitle{Binomial Distribution: Expected Value and Variance}


If the random variable X has a binomial distribution with parameters n
and p, we write
\[ X \sim B(n,p) \]

Expectation and Variance
If $X \sim B(n,p)$, then:

\begin{itemize}
\item Expected Value of X : $E(X) = np$
\item Variance of X : $Var(X) = np(1-p)$
\end{itemize}

Suppose n=3 and p=0.5 
Then $E(X) = 1.5$ and $V(X) = 0.75$.

Remark: Referring to the expected value and variance may be used to validate
the assumption of a binomial distribution.

\frametitle{Poisson Experiment}
A Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item The experiment results in outcomes that can be classified as successes or failures.
\item The average number of successes (m) that occurs in a specified region is known.
\item The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
\item The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero.
\end{itemize}
Note that the specified region could take many forms. For instance, it could be a length, an area, a volume, a period of time, etc.

\frametitle{Poisson Formulae}
The probability that there will be $k$ occurrences in a unit time period is denoted $P(X=k)$, and is computed as follows.

\[ P(X = k)=\frac{m^k e^{-m}}{k!} \]

\begin{itemize}
\item $2^0$ = 1

\frametitle{The Cumulative Distribution Function}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Cumulative Distribution Function, denoted $F(x)$, is a common way that the probabilities
of a random variable (both discrete and continuous) can be summarized.
\item The Cumulative Distribution Function, which also can be
described by a formula or summarized in a table, is defined as:
\[F(x) = P(X \leq x) \]
\item The notation for a cumulative distribution function, F(x), entails using a capital
"F".  (The notation for a probability mass or density function, f(x), i.e. using a lowercase "f". The notation is not interchangeable.

\frametitle{Useful Results}
(Demonstration on the blackboard re: partitioning of the sample space, using examples on next slide)
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(X \leq 1) = P(X=0) + P(X=1)$
\item $P(X \leq r) = P(X=0)+ P(X=1) + \ldots P(X= r)$
\item $P(X \leq 0) = P(X=0)$
\item $P(X = r) = P(X \geq r ) - P(X \geq r + 1)$
\item \textbf{Complement Rule}: $P(X \leq r-1) = P(X < r) = 1 - P(X \geq r)$
\item \textbf{Interval Rule}:$ P(a \leq X \leq  b)= P(X \geq a) - P(X \geq b + 1).$
\end{itemize}
For the binomial distribution, if the probability of success is greater than 0.5, instead of
considering the number of successes, to use the table we consider
the number of failures.

Suppose a signal of 100 bits is transmitted and the probability of
sending a bit correctly is 0.9. What is the probability of
\begin{enumerate}
\item at least 10 errors
\item exactly 7 errors
\item Between 5 and 15 errors (inclusively).
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Binomial Example 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since the probability of success is 0.9. We consider the distribution
of the number of failures (errors).
\item We reverse the definition of `success' and `failure'. Success is now defined as an error.
\item The probability that a bit is sent incorrectly is 0.1.
\item Let X be the total number of errors. $X \sim B(100, 0.1)$.
\item Answer : $P(X \geq 10) = 0.5487$.
\item $P(X = 7)=P(X \geq 7) - P(X \geq 8) =0.8828 - 0.7939 = 0.0889$.
\item $P(5 \leq X  \leq 15) = P(X \geq 5) - P(X \geq 16) =0.9763 - 0.0399 = 0.9364$

\begin{itemize}
\item A Poisson random variable is the number of successes that result from a Poisson experiment.
\item The probability distribution of a Poisson random variable is called a Poisson distribution.
\item Very Important: This distribution describes the number of occurrences in a \textbf{\emph{unit period (or space)}}
\item Very Important: The expected number of occurrences is $m$
\end{itemize}
}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Poisson Probability Distribution}
We use the following notation.
\[X \sim Poisson(m) \]
Note the expected number of occurrences per unit time is conventionally denoted $\lambda$ rather than $m$.
\bigskip
As the Murdoch Barnes cumulative Poisson Tables (Table 2) use $m$, so shall we. Recall that Tables 2 gives values of the probability $P(X \geq r )$, when X has a Poisson distribution with
parameter $m$.

Consider cars passing a point on a rarely used country road. Is this a Poisson Random Variable?
Suppose
\begin{enumerate}
\item Arrivals occur at an average rate of $m$ cars per unit time.
\item The probability of an arrival in an interval of length k
is constant.
\item The number of arrivals in two non-overlapping
intervals of time are independent.
\end{enumerate}
This would be an appropriate use of the Poisson Distribution.
