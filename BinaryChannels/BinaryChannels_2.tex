Certainly. Here's a clean and organized Markdown version of the solution to your binary channel question:

---

## (a) Binary Channels (5 Marks)

Letâ€™s address each part of the question clearly and concisely.

---

### (i) Channel Matrix (1 Mark)

From the figure, assume the conditional probabilities are:

- \( P(Y_1 | X_1) = 0.8 \), \( P(Y_2 | X_1) = 0.2 \)  
- \( P(Y_1 | X_2) = 0.3 \), \( P(Y_2 | X_2) = 0.7 \)

The **channel matrix** \( [P(Y|X)] \) is:

\[
[P(Y|X)] = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.8 & 0.2 \\
0.3 & 0.7
\end{bmatrix}
\]

---

### (ii) Output Probabilities \( P(Y_1) \) and \( P(Y_2) \) (2 Marks)

Given:
- \( P(X_1) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(X_2) = 0.3 \)

We compute output probabilities:

\[
P(Y_1) = P(X_1)P(Y_1 | X_1) + P(X_2)P(Y_1 | X_2) = (0.7)(0.8) + (0.3)(0.3) = 0.56 + 0.09 = 0.65
\]
\[
P(Y_2) = P(X_1)P(Y_2 | X_1) + P(X_2)P(Y_2 | X_2) = (0.7)(0.2) + (0.3)(0.7) = 0.14 + 0.21 = 0.35
\]

---

### (iii) Joint Probabilities \( P(X_1, Y_1) \) and \( P(X_2, Y_2) \) (2 Marks)

\[
P(X_1, Y_1) = P(X_1)P(Y_1 | X_1) = (0.7)(0.8) = 0.56
\]
\[
P(X_2, Y_2) = P(X_2)P(Y_2 | X_2) = (0.3)(0.7) = 0.21
\]
